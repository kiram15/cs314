This semester long project was an "internship at TripCo, a startup travel planning company." In a team of 4 people, we built an application using scrum-based development to support the business. From the begining to the end of the semester, the development team completed 5 3-week sprints that accomplished: 

- Reading data from a CSV file to interacting with a SQL database.
- Creating an iterinerary from computing the mileage between over 100,000 destinations, to ordering the destinations for the most efficient trip using Nearest Neighbor, 2-opt, and 3-opt algorithms.
- A JSON version of the itinerary to a server that packaged the information needed by the to render the itinerary and deliver it.
- A client that just rendered the information it was provided, to an interactive single page application.
