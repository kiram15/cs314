Kira Miller, ESTJ

1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What
hours?
Text is best

2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
I want to have a fleshed out final project that I can possibly present at future
interviews.

3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication
skills this semester?
I want concentrate on setting aside allocated time to dedicate to this project
with the team so other things don’t get prioritized over it, and I want to focus on
being understanding when things come up, but also coming up with, as a team,
goals for every week.

4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and
personal goals?
I think that obstacles could be if me or the people on my team aren’t pulling their
weight or putting in the time, or if people have something come up (sickness,
family stuff, etc).

5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a
“B” will be acceptable?
I think no matter what grade people want, everyone should still be putting in the
same amount of work

6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in
order to get an “A”?
No, see answer above. Everyone should be trying their hardest.

7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project
successful?
At least 2-3 hours of time with the full group, along with a couple of hours
getting projects finished on your own.

8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
Talk about what people’s strengths are as a team and delegate as a team.

9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing
deadline, no show, etc.)?
If its just because of a crazy week, the other team can pick up the slack, but if it
happens again, we will have a team meeting and possibly include Dave.

10.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
We will discuss as a group what we believe is good work, and talk openly if we
believe someone’s work is not up to par.

11.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
As long as their work gets done by weekly deadlines set and they make it to the
team meetings, people can deal with different work habits on their own.

12.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Yes

13.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
At least once a week.

14.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
It depends on what decision is being made, but if ¾ of the team agrees it
passes by majority

15.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Majority rules, but also try to talk to see if a compromise can be agreed upon

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
The other three will hopefully step up and let them know that they’re not being a
team player.

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on
you?
Talk to the team about setting more strict work allocations so all the extra work
doesn’t fall to one person.
