# Sprint 2 - *T02* - *NEKA*

## Goal

### A shorter trip with a better itinerary.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a JAR file containing the executables to be used for the demo. 
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.
* No outstanding branches, commits, pull requests.

## Policies

* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* Tests are written before/with code.  
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the affected code.
