Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | We communicate well | We need to share knowledge of each user story betweent team members  | Stay updated on team member's work by doing more in depth pull request review and talk about progress during standups
**Process** | Established good team meetings, prompt with approving pull requests | Stay updated on piazza and other consumer requirements. | Update team members on important piazza posts and changes in requirements
**Tools** | Not editing master directly, not merging broken code | We need to work on coding and testing locally more efficiently | We will test locally more thoroughly before creating pull requests
