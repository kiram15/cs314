# Sprint 3 - *T02* - NEKA

## Goal

### A web based solution with shorter trips and a large data source.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | make sure we checkin with teammates | add extra meetings | focus on JUnit test
What we did well | communicated effectively, checked in with teammates, more effective meetings | added extra meetings, time estimates, checking piazza | better use of githhub, React, IntelliJ, extra languages
What we need to work on | Remind people to work earlier, better balance of checking in and working on our stuff | better time planning split up issues more, more issue assignment instead of database/website/server/client | better use of JUnit/code coverage, tunneling database
What we will change next time | work earlier, work better as a team | better initial planning, get started earlier | Code coverage, JUnit, SQL
