*Teamwork Questionnaire*
1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
    1. Text and email work best for me.
    1. Before 10:30pm and after 7:00am
1. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
  1. I expect us to complete the assignments thoroughly and on time. I’m not expecting us to go above and beyond the requirements but rather meet the class expectations
1. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
  1. My goals are to reply to text messages within an hour of receiving them and to communicate to my group if I’m struggling with something rather than just suffering in silence and holding the group back
1. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
  1. My busy schedule with class, work and gphi will be an obstacle but as long as we set aside time in advance and plan out meetings it shouldn’t be an issue. It’s only a problem when I don’t get enough notice to get excused from gphi events/work.
1. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
  1. I think we should talk about our grade expectations in advance. Based on previous classes/groups with these members I can assume that we will all be aiming for A’s (thank you grade anxiety)
1. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
  1. I think this might be acceptable in the case where the person is an expert in that area, as long as this “expert” status is not for every assignment. In other words, I think it is okay for one person to do more work on one sprint as long as this balances out in the next sprint (i.e. one person is not always doing more work than everyone else)
1. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
  1. ~5 hours per week (from the descriptions the professor has given us)
1. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
  1. At the start of a new sprint we will come up with all the “issues”/work that needs to be done and then divvy it up based on previous knowledge/preferences
1. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
  1. If they communicate this problem to the group early enough then we can help work with them. However, if they wait too long as a group we will have an “intervention” with them for the first offense and then after that if it is still happening, set up a meeting with the professor to talk about why it keeps happening
1. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
  1. We should set standards at the beginning for what our quality expectations are
1. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
  1. I think different work habits are not a problem unless it starts to affect other members’ ability to complete their work. (ex: they can’t do something until their part is finished). When we divvy up the work for the different sprints, we should also think about what tasks need to be done in which order and then set mini group deadlines for those branches.
1. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
  1. Yes
1. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
  1. Twice a week for a few hours at a time
1. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
  1. Big picture/design decisions yes. In terms of approving code before adding it to the master, no. 
1. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
  1. Majority rules on most issues for time/simplicity, unless the one member is extremely against it, then majority rules.
1. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
  1. If it becomes a problem, it is up to the rest of the members of the group to say something to them. A lot of times they don’t necessarily even notice they are doing it, and just need someone to point it out so that they can take a step back. If it gets really bad we should set up a meeting with the professor.
1. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
  1. Similar answer, I will talk to my group and explain how I’m feeling.
