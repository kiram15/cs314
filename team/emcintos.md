1.	Reach me by text, any time of the day, other than between 11:00pm and 7:00am
2.	I expect my team to do their work well and on time, and I expect us to accomplish all that is expected of us.
3.	I hope to improve my skills as a team member contributing to a scrum team in an Agile environment. I also hope to be better at communicating my expectations to teams and team members
4.	Obstacles I might encounter include miscommunication, scheduling conflicts, and conflicts with other classes.
5.	The team should attempt to perform to the highest standards that have been set for them, and provide a product that meets all team member’s expectations
6.	Yes it is acceptable, but they should communicate what work is being done to improve the product.
7.	I do not know the scope of the project, so I cannot make an educated guess, but I’d assume around 8 hours a week per person.
8.	The team should work together to divide the work, based on skills and interests in what may be required.
9.	The team should attempt to pick up slack, but if it keeps happening, it would become an issue.
10.	Pull Requests and code review should be able to keep code and other work at a consistent level of quality, agreed upon at the beginning, but subject to change.
11.	Team members should become familiar with the different work habits of their teammates, and know what is to be expected of them, and when in relation to the deadline.
12.	I don’t think it’s necessary, but am not opposed to it.
13.	The team will meet as much as necessary.
14.	There should be no unilateral decisions, and every team member should be at least somewhat comfortable with the decision.
15.	Attempt to explain the thought on both sides, and work together to provide a solution that works for everyone
16.	Let them know, but if the rest of the team is okay with it, I see no problem.
17.	I will try to pick up the load, but would not hesitate to try and distribute the work more evenly if it becomes too much.
